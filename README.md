# MythOS | Forked from GodotOS

Welcome to **MythOS**, a customizable operating system interface built entirely in Godot! MythOS is a fork of [GodotOS](https://github.com/popcar2/GodotOS), adapted and maintained by me, [Your Name or Handle]. This project provides a minimalist, distraction-free, and aesthetically pleasing desktop-like experience for my own game I'm currently working on.

MythOS pushes the limits of UI design in Godot, providing a flexible foundation for creative projects. Unlike the original GodotOS, MythOS does not include the bundled games, focusing instead on providing a clean and customizable OS-like interface for my use case. If you are familiar with Linux distributions, you could say that MythOS is a derivative "distro" of GodotOS—but it's important to note that neither MythOS nor GodotOS are real operating systems. Both are applications with interfaces that resemble an OS, created entirely in Godot, and are intended as creative projects or "toys" rather than functional system software.

## Usage, Licensing & Source Code

MythOS is **free to use for anyone** and is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html), as required by the original GodotOS project.

**Important licensing note:**  
If you include MythOS (or any AGPLv3-licensed code) as part of your own game or application and distribute it (for example, by selling, sharing, or making it available online), the AGPLv3 requires you to make the **complete source code of your entire game/application** available under the same license. You cannot release only the MythOS source code; you must release the source for your whole project if you distribute it with MythOS included.

At this time, MythOS is being developed specifically for integration into my own game. I plan to make the source code for my game public in the future, but it is **not currently available**.

*Usage*

While MythOS will soon be integrated into my own game, you are absolutely welcome to use MythOS in your own projects as well. The project is free and open under the AGPLv3 license—feel free to adapt, modify, and build upon it for your own creative ideas!
